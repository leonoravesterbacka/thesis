\chapter{Search for direct slepton\\ production}\label{sec:slepton}
\noindent\justify
Finally, the production mode with the lowest cross section associated to it is treated. 
Direct production of selectrons and smuons provide a very clean final state that makes for a simple but effective search design. 
To first order, no hadronic activity is expected, giving a great handle to reducing SM background processes by imposing a jet veto. 
A 100\% branching ratio of sleptons to leptons and the \firstchi LSP is assumed, that allows for a search with large \ptmiss requirements.

In any big collaboration such as CMS, no researcher can solely claim the responsibility of the results of an analysis. 
Instead, all analyses rely on the support of thousands of colleagues in building the experiment, collecting the data, validating the data, deriving corrections and so on. 
While keeping the importance of collaboration in mind, one can still acknowledge individual contributions. 
As opposed to the searches presented in the two previous chapters that were performed in collaboration with four other institutes, the search for direct slepton production was performed solely by the author of this thesis.

\section{Analysis strategy}   
\noindent
\justify
The searches presented so far have the commonality of requiring at least two jets in the final state.
The search for direct slepton production differs in the fact that no hadronic activity is expected.
The slepton SR is therefore designed to veto jets within $|\eta|=2.4$ and of $\pt>25\GeV$.
%This results in different sources of SM backgrounds. 
Further, the slepton SR is designed using the leptonic \mttwo variable, and the leading lepton \pt required to be above 50\GeV. 
These specific selections result in different sources of SM backgrounds compared to the colored and electroweak searches presented in the previous chapters. 
In the search for sleptons, limits are set on the selectrons and smuon production in dielectron and dimuon final states separately.
The reason for this is because a priori, the mass of the selectrons and smuons have no reason to be the same, in the same way as the mass of the electrons and muons are not the same. 
For this reason, the SR is defined for dielectron and dimuon events separately, and combined.

\section{Background estimation}
\subsection*{Flavor symmetric background}
\noindent\justify
The main FS background in the slepton search is stemming from \PWW production.
This is in contrast to the general strong and electroweak search, where the main background is due to \ttbar.
The \ttbar is reduced in the slepton search as all jets are vetoed, making the \PWW the main FS contribution.
As the \ttbar enriched control region that is used to measure the \Rsfof in the direct measurement method is very similar yet orthogonal to the Edge signal region, an extrapolation of this factor to     the signal region is easily validated.
The problem arise in the slepton search, where the \ttbar control region is far from the slepton signal region that has a veto on jets.
For this reason, additional checks are performed to validate the various factors of the FS background prediction method as a function of number of jets.
As can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:rmueSlepton}, no trend is observed in the \rmue and the 0.5($r_{\mu/e}^{corr.}+1/r_{\mu/e}^{corr.}$) variables in the low jet multiplicities, indicating that there is     no problem to extrapolate the results to the slepton SR.

\label{fig:rmueSlepton}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
\newpara
\noindent\justify
However, a trend is observed for the \Rsfof from the direct measurement in the 0 jet bin. This can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:rsfofSleptonOne}.
\begin{figure}[htbp!]
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.49\textwidth]{images/rsfof/plot_rsfof_njetFSonly.png}

\label{fig:rsfofSleptonOne}
\end{center}
\end{figure} 
This trend in the first jet bin could indeed cause some worry.
This increase in the number of same flavor events in the 0 jet bin is due to the DY process, which is present in the \ttbar enriched control region after relaxing the jet requirement.
This statement is further motivated by the fact that the discrepancy show up in data and not in MC where only FS processes are included.
But since the signal region is designed with a cut of \mttwo$\geq90\GeV$, the \Rsfof can instead be validated in the jet veto case by requiring a \mttwo$\geq40\GeV$ which is reducing a large fraction of DY contribution while maintaining reasonable statistics.
Figure \ref{fig:rsfofSleptonTwo} shows the \Rsfof as a function of number of jets in the \ttbar control region, but with a requirement that the events that have 0 jets must have a \mttwo within $40-90\GeV$ (the upper requirement is added to avoid unblinding), and a good agreement between data and simulation is obtained, indicating that the extrapolation to the 0 jet SR is fine as long as the SR is defined with a \mttwo requirement.

The MC simulation takes into account all flavor symmetric and non-flavor symmetric processes such as DY.}

Further, the slepton search is the only search presented in this thesis that has interpretations in the dielectron and dimuon channels separately.
The reason behind this is that there is no a priori reason why the selectrons and smuons should have the same masses, so grouping them together and only interpret in the terms of same-flavor sleptons is not enough.\footnote{Of course, the interpretation in selectrons and smuons separately is also desirable as it gives separate entries in the PDG booklet. }
But since the factorization method utilizes the measurement of \rmue and \RT, that uses a mixture of measurements for electrons and muons.
This means that the \rmue or \RT can not be used to predict the $N_{ee}$ or $N_{\mu\mu}$ separately.
Instead only the \Reeof and \Rmmof ratios from the direct measurement listed in Table \ref{tab:rSFOF} can be used to predict the $N_{ee}$ or $N_{\mu\mu}$.
The price to pay by only using one of the methods instead of the combined one is that one can not profit from the reduced systematic uncertainty that on gets in the combination of the two methods.
But, as might have already been noted, the drawback of the FS background prediction method is the large statistical errors associated to the poorly populated OF event bins in the SR.
So a reduction in the systematic uncertainty as a result of a combination of the two methods is still a small reduction compared to the large statistical error.
Table \ref{tab:FlavSymBackgroundsSlepton} summarizes the resulting background estimates for FS backgrounds in the slepton signal regions, split into the SF leptons, dielectron and dimuon signal regions.

From this region, a transfer factor is derived that is applied in the slepton signal region to account for the slight difference in normalization observed in the three lepton control region.
An additional systematic uncertainty is assigned to this method, by letting the jet energy scale corrections vary up and down in the computation of the \ptmiss, and the difference in the yield in the     background and \PWZ MC is propagated to the error on the final scale factor.
The resulting transfer factor is $1.06\pm0.06$, where the 6\% is the statistical uncertainty on the data in the control region which is taken as a systematic uncertainty on the method.
Further, systematic uncertainties such as the variations of the jet energy scale and resolution, as well as PDF anc scale variations is evaluated for this method, which will be further explained in Section\ref{sec:systs}.
The transfer factor is presented in Table \ref{tab:WZslepton}, using the MC samples summarized in Table\ref{tab:3lMCsamples} in Appendix A.

\subsection*{\PZZ$\rightarrow2l2\nu$ background}
\noindent\justify
In the slepton search, the \PZZ$\rightarrow2l2\nu$ process is dominant, especially in the high \ptmiss signal regions.
This process can enter the signal region if the leptonically decaying \PZ boson is off-shell, producing a lepton pair that escapes the \PZ boson veto.
This process is estimated from simulation, after validating the simulation in a four lepton control region, enriched in the Z$\mathrm{Z^{*}}\rightarrow$4l process.
This control region enables for the validation of the modeling of the lepton pair from the off-shell \PZ boson, by treating the other two leptons that are compatible with a good \PZ candidate as neutrinos. 
The \pt of the leptons forming the best \PZ candidate is added to the \ptmiss, so to mimic the \ptmiss produced if these charged leptons were replaced with neutrinos.
The agreement between the data and the simulation is checked in variables such as the \ptmiss and the \mttwo recomputed with the remaining leptons and the emulated \ptmiss.
The four lepton control region used for the slepton search is defined as
\begin{itemize} 
    \item four tight ID leptons of any flavor or charge with $\pt\geq25\GeV$ for the leading and $\pt\geq20\GeV$ for the subsequent leptons
    \item the leptons that form the best \PZ candidate is required to have \mll within 76 to 106\GeV. 
    \item the leptons that form the other \PZ candidate is required to have \mll within 50 to 130\GeV.

A NNLO/NLO k-factor is applied to the \PZZ$\rightarrow 2l2\nu$ and \PZZ$\rightarrow 4l$ simulation, which is provided as a function of the generator level \pt, mass and \dphi of the diboson system.
The diboson \pt dependent k-factor is eventually applied to the \PZZ$\rightarrow 2l2\nu$  prediction in the signal region, and an uncertainty on the shape is derived as the difference between the distributions after applying the \pt dependent k-factor and no k-factor, after both distributions are normalized to their areas.
The distributions of the generator \pt and mass of the diboson systems in the slepton signal region is presented in Figure~\ref{kfactor}, after the respective k-factor has been applied.

A transfer factor of 0.94 is obtained with a statistical uncertainty of 7\%, and this 7\% is used as a systematic uncertainty on the method. 
As the slepton signal region is defined with a selection of leading leptons of \pt greater than 50 \GeV, this differs from the control region definition of \pt greater than 25 \GeV to maintain the statistical power of the sample.

\subsection*{Drell-Yan}

The Drell-Yan is a subdominant background in the slepton search, as it is heavily suppressed by the \PZ boson veto, the jet veto, the large \mttwo and \ptmiss requirements.
For this reason the background is predicted from simulation, in order to avoid large systematic uncertainties due to the poorly populated \ptmiss bins.
Similarly to the Drell-Yan treatment in the edge search, an \Routin method is used to transfer the prediction of events on the \PZ peak to outside of the \PZ window.
The difference is that the events in the \PZ window is taken from simulation.
As the slepton signal region is not binned in the invariant mass like the edge search is, the \Routin only needs to be computed twice, \Routin above and below the \PZ window.

\subsection*{Systematic uncertainties for signal}
\noindent\justify
The magnitude of the systematic uncertainties in search for direct slepton production is summarizes in Table \ref{tab:systematicsSleptons}.
In addition to the sources of systematic uncertainties discussed in Chapter \ref{sec:systs}, additional \ptmiss uncertainties are evaluated for the signal simulation in the slepton analysis. 
As the main physics objects in the slepton analysis are the leptons and the \ptmiss, it is crucial to evaluate how the \ptmiss changes if the energy of one of the other objects in the event varies. 
The muon energy scale, the electron energy scale and the unclustered energy scale is varied up and down by $1\sigma$, and the effect is propagated to the \ptmiss. 
This results in a quite sizeable effect, especially in the muon case where the uncertainty is up to 20\%, driven by a few signal events with very high \pt muons.

Finally, the predicted background compared to the observed yields in the signal regions designed to target direct slepton production is presented. 
As opposed to the results previously presented, the signal regions is not only categorized by SF lepton pairs, but is further categorized in dielectron and dimuon pairs. 
The observed number of events in data in the SR are compared with the stacked SM background estimates as shown in Figure \ref{fig:results} (SF events), and summarized in Table \ref{tab:results} for SF events and in Table \ref{tab:resultseemm} for dielectron and dimuon events, separately.
The \mttwo shape of the stacked SM background estimates, the observed data and three signal scenarios are also shown in Figure \ref{fig:results}, for SF events, with all SR selection applied except the \mttwo requirement.

\section{Interpretation}
\noindent
\justify
Upper limits on the direct slepton pair production cross section are displayed in Figure \ref{fig:TOT} for three scenarios: assuming the existence of both flavor mass degenerate left- and
right-handed sleptons, for only left-handed sleptons, and for only right-handed sleptons. 
Similarly, the limits on direct selectron and smuon production are displayed in Figures \ref{fig:TOTee} and \ref{fig:TOTmm}, respectively.
The Figures \ref{fig:TOT} \ref{fig:TOTmm} also show the $95\%$ \CL exclusion contours, as a function of the \slep and \lsp masses.
Note that the cross section at a given mass for right-handed sleptons is expected to be about one third of that for left-handed sleptons.
The analysis probes slepton masses up to approximately 450, 400, or 290\GeV, assuming both left- and right-handed, left-handed only, or right-handed sleptons, and a massless LSP.
For models with high slepton masses and light LSPs the sensitivity is driven by the highest \ptmiss bin. The sensitivity is reduced at higher LSP masses due to the effect of the lepton acceptance.
In the case of selectrons (smuons), the limits corresponding to these 3 scenarios are 350, 310 and 250\GeV (310, 280, and 210\GeV).
Since the dimuon data yield in the highest \ptmiss\ bin is somewhat higher than predicted, the observed limits in this channel are weaker than expected in the absence of signal.
These results improve the previous 8\TeV exclusion limits by 100--150\GeV in the slepton mass \cite{Khachatryan:2014qwa}.

\section{Summary}
\noindent
\justify
This chapter has outlined a search for direct slepton (selectron or smuon) production, in events with opposite sign, same flavor leptons, no jets, and missing transverse momentum.
Observations are in agreement with expectations from the SM within the statistical and systematic uncertainties.
Slepton masses up to 290, 400 and 450\GeV respectively are excluded at 95\% confidence level, assuming a massless LSP. 
Exclusion limits are also provided assuming a massless LSP and right-handed only, left-handed only and right-and left-handed single flavor production scenarios, excluding selectron (smuon) masses up to 250, 310 and 350\GeV (210, 280 and 310\GeV), respectively.
These results improve the previous exclusion limits measured by the CMS experiment at a center-of-mass energy of 8\TeV by 100–-150\GeV in slepton masses.
